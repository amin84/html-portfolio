    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I come from an Accounting background and aiming to break into the world of
      IT. I have always had a keen interest in programming and have been coding
      on and off for the past 10 years. Coding feels like a super power because
      through it, you can essentially speak to computers in ways we normally
      cannot.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have self-studied many programming languages such as C++, Java, Python,
      and a little bit of JavaScript and have made some small projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now I am learning Web Development not only to understand how to
      build a website, but also to learn the various technologies that exist in
      the programming world.
